The results from the time-based method are shown in red, and the results from our method are shown in blue. Each of the four strips shows time series plots of the gait phase percentage and the resulting commanded torque profiles for various locomotion modes and mode transitions. The RMSE for the specific mode/mode transition is listed at the top of each cell. The ground truth gait phase percentage and corresponding profiles are shown in grey. What is really cool here is that our model created very smooth estimates of gait phase and smooth assistance profiles, in transition steps as well.

The first part of this involved taking the IMU data and transforming it into the appropriate reference frame, using the encoder and some relationships from rigid body dynamics. The next step was calculating two separate estimates of the cube angle - one from the accelerometer reading, and one from the gyroscope reading. For the accelerometer estimate, there are actually two equations we can use - one that involves a cosine term and another that involves a sine term. Depending on the angle of the inner sphere, these terms could diverge as they might divide by a very small number. This is shown in the figure below (blue and orange). One method of getting an angle from the accelerometer data is to choose one equation if the sphere angle is less than 45 degrees and the other equation if the sphere angle is greater than 45 degrees.

By always starting the cube on its side, the initial angle of the cube will be consistent. After that, the angular velocity can be integrated over time to find the current angle. Since the IMU is on the rotating inner sphere, I had to do some rigid body dynamics and use the encoder to get the angular velocity of interest from the output of the IMU. By keeping a relatively consistent control loop rate (I say relatively because the timing fluctuates with Arduinos), we can numerically integrate the angular velocity using the period of the control loop. Now that we have our two angle estimates, we try to compensate for their weaknesses. The issue with the accelerometer estimate is that it is very noisy and sensitive to vibrations (this is important because the flywheel creates many vibrations). The issue with the gyroscope estimate is that it can drift over time. In order to create a robust estimate, we used a complementary filter with these two quantities. The idea here is that the accelerometer gives very good low-frequency data and is stable over long periods of time, while the gyroscope gives very good high-frequency data and is reliable in the short term but not over long periods. So we can lowpass filter the accelerometer estimate and highpass filter the gyroscope estimate, and have a weighted sum of the two.
